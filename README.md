dotfiles
========
Profile setup for osx/linux systems.

Installation
------------
Run `install.sh` to create links from the dotfiles to the user home directory.

Notes
-----
* manually install [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/). Should probably just use `brew` to install it
* Targeted at OSX; need to update it to work on linux
